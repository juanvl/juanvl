### Hello!

I'm Juan, a software developer since 2012.

I work as a Frontend developer and currently work mainly with ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-black?style=flat-square&logo=react) + ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-007ACC?style=flat-square&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

"Nothing in this world beats good old persistence. Talent does not surpass. Nothing more common than talented failures. Genius does not overcome. Unrecognized geniuses is practically a cliche. Education does not exceed. The world is full of educated fools. Persistence and determination alone are powerful."
